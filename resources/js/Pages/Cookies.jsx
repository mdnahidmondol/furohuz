A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site. It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, location, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time; this way, you don't have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another.</p>

                                Some people prefer not to allow cookies in their browser, which is why most browsers give you the ability to manage cookies to suit you.

                                You can control and/or delete cookies as you wish. For example, you can delete all cookies that are already stored in your computer and you can set most browsers to prevent them from being placed. If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit this or other websites. Additionally, some services and functionalities may not work.</p>

                                With some browsers you can set up rules to manage cookies on a site-by-site basis, giving you more granular control over your privacy. What this means is that you can disallow cookies from all sites except those that you trust.</p>
